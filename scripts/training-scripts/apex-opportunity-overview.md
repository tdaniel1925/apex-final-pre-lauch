## SCRIPT

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

Welcome to Apex Affinity Group. I'm excited to share with you what makes our organization truly different in the insurance industry.

If you're hearing this, you're likely exploring whether Apex is the right fit for you. Whether you're a seasoned insurance professional or just starting your journey, what I'm about to share will help you understand why Apex isn't just another insurance opportunity—it's a movement to transform how the entire industry operates.

---

### The Traditional Model Problem (0:30 - 2:00)

Let me start by being honest about something: the insurance industry has a problem.

For decades, insurance agents have been sold on the idea that success means competition. That your fellow agents are your rivals. That the only way to win is for someone else to lose.

This mentality has created an industry filled with isolated agents, working alone, reinventing the wheel over and over again. Agents struggling to find leads, figure out marketing, master new products, and navigate compliance—all by themselves.

And here's what's worse: when agents DO find solutions that work—a great lead generation strategy, an effective sales script, a compliance checklist that saves time—they keep it to themselves. Because sharing means giving competitors an advantage.

The result? Thousands of talented insurance professionals burning out, giving up, or just surviving instead of thriving.

We looked at this broken system and asked a simple question: **What if we flipped the entire model?**

---

### The Apex Philosophy (2:00 - 4:00)

Here's our core belief, and I want you to really hear this:

**Every insurance agent in America is our customer—whether they join Apex or not.**

Let me say that again. *Every insurance agent is our customer.*

This isn't just a nice slogan. It's the foundation of everything we do.

You see, at Apex, we don't view other agents as competition. We view the entire insurance industry as our community to serve. Our mission isn't just to help Apex team members succeed—it's to elevate the entire profession.

Now, you might be thinking: "That sounds great, but how does that actually work? How do you run a business with that philosophy?"

Great question. Here's how.

**First, the products.** Yes, we offer exceptional insurance products. Life insurance, health insurance, final expense, Medicare supplements—products that genuinely help families protect what matters most. We've partnered with top-rated carriers to ensure our team members have competitive, high-quality solutions to offer their clients.

But here's the key distinction: **our products are the vehicle, not the destination.**

What we're really building is an ecosystem of tools, training, resources, and technology that serve the entire insurance community.

Think of us as the infrastructure layer for the insurance industry. We're building the roads, the bridges, the utilities that every agent needs—and we're making them available to everyone.

### How This Works in Practice (4:00 - 6:30)

Let me give you some concrete examples of what "serving the industry" actually looks like.

**Example 1: Tools and Technology**

We've developed cutting-edge sales tools—CRM systems, lead nurturing platforms, client management software, marketing automation. These tools are so valuable that agents outside of Apex are willing to pay to use them.

When they do, we're serving them. They get better at their job. They close more deals. They serve their clients better. And yes, we generate revenue—which we reinvest into making our tools even better, which serves the industry even more.

**Example 2: Training and Education**

You're listening to this training right now. This same quality of training—sales techniques, product knowledge, compliance updates, personal development—we make available industry-wide.

Why? Because a better-trained insurance industry benefits everyone. Better agents mean better client experiences. Better client experiences mean more trust in insurance. More trust means a healthier industry for all of us.

**Example 3: Lead Generation and Marketing**

We've cracked the code on digital marketing for insurance. Most agents struggle with this. We don't just help our team members get leads—we teach the methodology. We publish content. We share strategies.

When an independent agent implements our marketing system and writes more business, we celebrate that. That agent is now serving more families. That's a win for the industry.

### The Apex Team Member Advantage (6:30 - 8:30)

Now, you might be wondering: "If you're serving everyone, what's the advantage of actually joining Apex as a team member?"

Excellent question. Here's the truth: **While we serve the entire industry, Apex team members get the full ecosystem, not just pieces of it.**

As an Apex team member, you get:

**All-Access Pass to the Ecosystem**
- Every tool, every training, every resource—included in your membership
- While non-members might pay for individual tools, you get the complete suite
- You're not just using the infrastructure—you're helping build it

**A Community of Abundance**
- You're surrounded by agents who share what works, because we know that rising tides lift all boats
- Collaboration channels, mastermind groups, mentor relationships
- When you have a breakthrough, you share it. When others do, they share with you.

**Multiple Income Streams**
- Commission on the insurance products you sell (like any agent)
- Revenue share from the technology ecosystem you help grow
- Bonuses for building and supporting a team
- Residual income from ongoing client relationships

**The 5x7 Matrix Structure**
- You're not alone in building your business—the entire organization works together
- Team members placed in your downline even when you didn't personally recruit them
- Leverage the power of collective growth

**But here's what matters most:** You're part of something bigger than yourself.

You're not just building an insurance business. You're part of a movement to professionalize and elevate the entire insurance industry. Every sale you make, every agent you mentor, every tool you help improve—you're contributing to a vision where insurance agents are respected professionals who genuinely serve families.

### The Bigger Mission (8:30 - 9:30)

Here's what gets me excited about Apex, and what I hope will excite you too:

We're proving that you can build a wildly successful business by serving others generously.

We're demonstrating that abundance mindset beats scarcity mindset—every single time.

We're showing that when you help the entire industry win, you win bigger than you ever would alone.

This is about legacy. It's about looking back ten years from now and knowing that because of Apex, there are thousands of insurance agents who are more successful, more fulfilled, and better equipped to serve families. And yes, many of those agents will be Apex team members—but many won't. And that's okay. Because we all win when the industry wins.

---

### Your Next Step (9:30 - 10:00)

So here's my question for you: Does this resonate with you?

Are you the kind of person who believes that serving others is the path to success?

Do you want to be part of an organization that's rewriting the rules of the insurance industry?

Are you ready to build a business where your success is multiplied by helping others succeed?

If you answered yes, then Apex Affinity Group might be exactly what you've been looking for.

Your next step is simple: **Talk to the person who shared this with you.** Ask questions. Get to know the team. See if this is the right fit.

Because at Apex, we're not just recruiting warm bodies. We're building a community of professionals who share a vision for what the insurance industry can become.

**Welcome to Apex. Welcome to a different way of doing business. Welcome home.**
