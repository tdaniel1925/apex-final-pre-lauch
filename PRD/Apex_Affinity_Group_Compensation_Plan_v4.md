## 2. Getting Started — Zero-Cost Enrollment

**Enrollment Fee: $0.00.** No starter kits, activation fees, or hidden charges.

### Active Status Requirement

Maintain **50 Personal BV (PBV)** per month to remain active. New distributors receive a **60-day grace period**.

### Typical Rep Monthly Economics

| Item | Monthly Cost | Commissionable? | BV Generated | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Custom Business Center | $39/mo | **No** | 0 BV | Optional — personalized back office, CRM, marketing hub |
| AgentPulse Software (avg) | ~$79/mo | **Yes** | ~40 BV | Most reps use at least one tool; counts toward 50 BV |
| **TOTAL** | **~$118/mo** | | **~40 BV** | $79 generates commissions for upline |

- The **$39 Business Center** is non-commissionable company revenue
- The **~$79 software subscription** generates BV and flows through the compensation plan
- **$0 enrollment fee. Free to join. Cancel anytime.**

### Compression Rule

Inactive distributors (below 50 PBV) are compressed in commission calculations. After 12 consecutive inactive months, the account is terminated.
